Canonical OpenClaw skill id: `memory-system`

An Agent long-term memory guide for OpenClaw, Codex, and Obsidian workflows.

It helps you build a durable local-first memory stack with a compact `MEMORY.md`, daily notes, session recovery files, and Obsidian archiving. OpenViking is included as an optional enhancement for semantic recall and summary support, not as a hard dependency.

Historical GitHub release archive: [v0.1.0](https://github.com/cjke84/agent-memory-system-guide/releases/tag/v0.1.0)

Registry / published skill version: `1.2.0`

## What it is

This skill explains how to build a durable memory stack for agents: a compact `MEMORY.md`, daily notes, memory distillation, and Obsidian backups.
It is a local-first workflow and file contract, not a hosted memory platform.
OpenViking is an optional enhancement for semantic recall and summary support.
Treat OpenViking, `memory_search`, or future memory services as optional recall backends rather than replacements for the local recovery layer.
OpenClaw's newer native memory, diary, grounded recall, and dreaming flows complement this repository rather than replace it; this guide stays focused on a portable, auditable local recovery layer.

Best fit:
- Agents that need persistent memory
- Agents that should keep daily notes and distill stable facts
- Users who want Obsidian as the long-term archive

## How to use

1. Install the skill.
2. Copy `templates/SESSION-STATE.md` and `templates/working-buffer.md`, then use them with `MEMORY.md` and daily notes.
3. Distill stable facts into long-term memory and keep raw notes in daily files.
4. Archive stable knowledge into Obsidian.

## OpenClaw compatibility

- This repository is currently documented against OpenClaw `v2026.4.11` (released 2026-04-12).
- The skill layout here follows the current OpenClaw Skills contract: `SKILL.md` frontmatter, workspace `skills/` installation, and a portable local-first recovery layer.
- Older OpenClaw versions can still use most of the workflow if they load standard `SKILL.md` files, but the preferred install path is the newer `openclaw skills install <slug>` flow.
- OpenClaw native memory, Active Memory, diary, grounded recall, dreaming, and newer import/wiki flows complement this repository; this guide still owns the readable, syncable, auditable local recovery layer.

## Post-install self-check

1. Confirm the skill is visible in your current OpenClaw workspace.
2. Run `python3 scripts/memory_capture.py bootstrap --workspace /path/to/workspace`.
3. Run `python3 scripts/memory_capture.py session-start --workspace /path/to/workspace` when you want the recovery layer initialized from turn 1 of a real session.
4. Confirm `SESSION-STATE.md`, `working-buffer.md`, and `memory-capture.md` were created or preserved as expected.
5. Run `python3 scripts/memory_capture.py report --workspace /path/to/workspace`, `python3 scripts/memory_capture.py doctor --workspace /path/to/workspace`, or `python3 scripts/memory_capture.py distill --workspace /path/to/workspace` depending on whether you want status, health checks, or a review-ready memory summary.

## File boundaries

- `SESSION-STATE.md` uses the compact repository template: `当前任务`, `已完成`, `卡点`, `下一步`, and `恢复信息`
- Do not expand it into a second detailed schema such as `Task`, `Status`, `Owner`, `Last Updated`, or `Cleanup Rule`
- If another workflow already emits those fields, merge them back into the compact sections instead of creating new headings
- `working-buffer.md` is the only short-term scratchpad; if another skill has a working buffer or WAL concept, it should reuse this file
- `MEMORY.md` is for startup-time quick reference
- `memory/` is for daily notes and deeper archive material
- Overlap between `MEMORY.md` and `memory/` is acceptable, but their retrieval roles are different
- Lookup order: `SESSION-STATE.md` first, then recent daily notes, then `MEMORY.md` or `memory_search`, and only then Obsidian or deeper archives

## Memory layers

- `SESSION-STATE.md`: active recovery state for the interrupted task
- `working-buffer.md`: rough notes, temporary decisions, and pre-distillation scratch space
- `MEMORY.md`: distilled long-term memory for stable preferences, conventions, decisions, and recurring pitfalls
- `memory/`: daily notes and project-scoped raw history
- Obsidian, `memory_search`, OpenViking, or another external tool: deeper archive or optional recall layer

Practical boundary:
- Use memory for durable profile and collaboration facts.
- Use daily notes for volatile execution history.
- Reach for archive or semantic recall only after the local recovery files stop being enough.

## Stable profile and project scope

- Bias `MEMORY.md` toward stable profile: preferences, naming conventions, architecture decisions, recurring pitfalls, and facts that should survive startup.
- Keep fast-changing execution detail in `SESSION-STATE.md`, `working-buffer.md`, and recent daily notes.
- If one workspace spans multiple projects, include a date, repo, or project tag when distilling notes into `MEMORY.md` so later retrieval stays scoped without introducing a new required schema.

## Memory capture

- Use `templates/memory-capture.md` as a low-friction end-of-task capture sheet.
- During the task, write rough notes into `working-buffer.md` under `临时决策`, `新坑`, and `待蒸馏`.
- After the task, spend 30 seconds generating candidate memory before deciding what belongs in `MEMORY.md`.
- Use `python3 scripts/memory_capture.py session-start --workspace /path/to/workspace` to initialize the recovery layer at session start, or `python3 scripts/memory_capture.py bootstrap --workspace /path/to/workspace` for one-time setup.
- The generated `memory-capture.md` now includes structured capture metadata such as `session_started_at`, `project`, `scope_tags`, `source_session`, a stable `candidate_document_id`, and a `stability` marker.
- After filling candidate items, run `python3 scripts/memory_capture.py distill --workspace /path/to/workspace` to produce a review-ready summary, then `python3 scripts/memory_capture.py apply --workspace /path/to/workspace` to write the deduplicated result into `MEMORY.md`.

## Practical Examples

### Workflow examples

### First-time workspace bootstrap

A first-time workspace bootstrap should start with copying the template files, then running `python3 scripts/memory_capture.py bootstrap --workspace /path/to/workspace` so your workspace immediately contains `SESSION-STATE.md`, `working-buffer.md`, and a refreshed `memory-capture.md`. Keep `MEMORY.md` as an intentional file you create and maintain yourself.

### Session-start initialization

Run `python3 scripts/memory_capture.py session-start --workspace /path/to/workspace` when a real session begins and you want the local recovery layer ready from turn 1. You can optionally add `--session-id`, `--project`, and repeated `--scope-tag` values so the generated `memory-capture.md` carries lightweight structured context and a stable `candidate_document_id`.

### End-of-task memory capture

The end-of-task memory capture rhythm comes down to converting the rough notes in `working-buffer.md` into candidate memories in `templates/memory-capture.md` while things are still fresh. `memory-capture.md` keeps entries like `候选决策` and `候选踩坑` tidy so the actual `MEMORY.md` edits stay concise and intentional.

### Daily note distillation

Daily note distillation is how you keep long-term memory lean. After closing out the day, review the most recent Markdown in `memory/`, pick the facts that other agents should recall, and weave them into `MEMORY.md`. Keep the original daily note for context, and rely on the distilled summary for quick lookups. This daily note distillation step keeps the long-term file small without losing the raw source.

### Memory is not generic RAG

This workflow treats memory as a layered system rather than a single retrieval bucket. `MEMORY.md` holds stable profile and durable collaboration facts, `memory/` keeps raw execution history, and Obsidian or optional semantic tools support deeper recall when needed. That keeps the workflow auditable and portable without turning this repository into a memory API product.

### Report examples

### Maintenance report command

The maintenance report command documents your workspace state without touching the memories themselves. Run `python3 scripts/memory_capture.py report --workspace /path/to/workspace` to print sections for Supported files, Directories, Latest daily note, and Warnings. The command scans the supported files (`MEMORY.md`, `SESSION-STATE.md`, `working-buffer.md`, `memory-capture.md`), walks the `memory/` and `attachments/` directories recursively, counts every file under `attachments/`, and counts only date-named daily notes such as `YYYY-MM-DD.md` under `memory/`. It identifies the lexicographically latest matching daily-note path under `memory/` as the latest daily note, so index or reference Markdown files do not skew the result. It exits 0 if the workspace is readable and only returns a non-zero status when the workspace directory is missing or cannot be opened, but it still prints the warning section whenever a problem occurs.

### Doctor command

Run `python3 scripts/memory_capture.py doctor --workspace /path/to/workspace` for a scoped health check that defaults to the active local recovery layer only. If Obsidian is actively part of the workflow, add `--obsidian-vault /path/to/vault` so `doctor` checks that layer too instead of warning about optional integrations you are not using.

### Distill command

Run `python3 scripts/memory_capture.py distill --workspace /path/to/workspace` to read the current `memory-capture.md` and generate a review-ready summary with `suggested_memory`, `recovery_only`, and `follow_up` buckets. It reuses the structured metadata already embedded in the capture sheet, merges candidate tags into the scope, and ignores untouched template prompt lines so an empty sheet does not create noisy pseudo-memories.

Add `--output /path/to/distill-report.md` when you want a Markdown review artifact. The report includes the `candidate_document_id`, groups suggested memory by bucket (`候选决策`, `候选踩坑`, `候选长期记忆`), and keeps recovery-only and follow-up items separate for quick human review.

### Apply command

Run `python3 scripts/memory_capture.py apply --workspace /path/to/workspace` to close the loop by writing the current distilled memory into `MEMORY.md`. It creates `MEMORY.md` if needed, writes only the long-term candidate buckets, and skips re-applying an entry when the same `candidate_document_id` already exists, so repeated runs stay idempotent.

Example stdout:

```text
Memory workspace report for /path/to/workspace

Supported files:
  MEMORY.md: present
  SESSION-STATE.md: present
  working-buffer.md: present
  memory-capture.md: present

Directories:
  memory: 2 daily note(s)
  attachments: 1 attachment(s)

Latest daily note: memory/2026-03-25.md

Warnings: none
```

Example warning-state stdout:

```text
Memory workspace report for /path/to/workspace

Supported files:
  MEMORY.md: present
  SESSION-STATE.md: missing
  working-buffer.md: present
  memory-capture.md: present

Directories:
  memory: 0 daily note(s)
  attachments: 0 attachment(s)

Latest daily note: none

Warnings:
  - Missing supported file: SESSION-STATE.md
  - memory directory has no daily notes
  - attachments directory is empty
```

Example Markdown report output:

Generate the file with:

```text
python3 scripts/memory_capture.py report --workspace /path/to/workspace --output /path/to/workspace-report.md
```

The generated `/path/to/workspace-report.md` will look like:

```markdown
# Memory workspace report

- Workspace: /path/to/workspace

## Supported files
- `MEMORY.md`: present
- `SESSION-STATE.md`: present
- `working-buffer.md`: present
- `memory-capture.md`: present

## Directories
- `memory`: 2 daily note(s)
- `attachments`: 1 attachment(s)

## Latest daily note
- memory/2026-03-25.md

## Warnings
- none
```

## Cross-device Backup and Restore

- Export a portable backup zip on the old device with `python3 scripts/memory_capture.py export --workspace /path/to/workspace --output /path/to/memory-backup.zip`.
- Move the archive to a new device and restore with `python3 scripts/memory_capture.py import --workspace /path/to/new-workspace --input /path/to/memory-backup.zip`.
- Default import is conservative: it always creates a pre-import backup, then performs an overwrite-style restore without deleting extra supported files already present in the target workspace.
- Use `python3 scripts/memory_capture.py import --clean --workspace /path/to/new-workspace --input /path/to/memory-backup.zip` when you want a deterministic clean restore of the supported memory surface.
- The archive includes `MEMORY.md`, `SESSION-STATE.md`, `working-buffer.md`, `memory-capture.md`, `memory/`, and `attachments/` when they exist.

## Obsidian setup guide

Keep the memory workflow inside one predictable vault layout:

```text
vault/
  MEMORY.md
  SESSION-STATE.md
  working-buffer.md
  memory-capture.md
  memory/
  attachments/
```

Recommended setup:
- Put daily notes in `memory/` so the CLI report and Obsidian navigation use the same path.
- Put pasted files, screenshots, and evidence in `attachments/` so embeds and backup exports stay portable.
- Use `templates/OBSIDIAN-NOTE.md` for durable notes that need frontmatter, backlinks, and embeds.
- Enable `Calendar` for date-based daily note browsing.
- Enable `Dataview` for querying `type`, `status`, `tags`, and `related`.
- Enable `Templater` for note scaffolding only; avoid making the core memory workflow depend on plugin automation.

Minimal Dataview query example:

```text
TABLE type, status, tags, related
FROM "memory"
WHERE status != "archived"
SORT updated desc
```

Sync guidance:
- Sync the whole vault, or at least the subset containing `MEMORY.md`, `memory/`, and `attachments/`.
- Keep unrelated plugin cache folders out of your sync rules.
- Obsidian sync remains optional; the local file workflow should still work on its own.

## Scheduled maintenance examples

Automate reporting and backup, not direct long-term-memory rewrites.

Daily report example with `crontab`:

```text
0 9 * * * cd /path/to/repo && python3 scripts/memory_capture.py report --workspace /path/to/workspace --output /path/to/workspace-report.md
```

Weekly backup example with `crontab`:

```text
0 18 * * 5 cd /path/to/repo && python3 scripts/memory_capture.py export --workspace /path/to/workspace --output /path/to/backups/
```

Practical rule:
- Schedule checks, reports, and backups automatically.
- Use `distill` for review and `apply` for the explicit write step; avoid hidden background rewrites of `MEMORY.md`.

## Sync options and trade-offs

- `Obsidian Sync`: best if Obsidian is your main interface and you want the smoothest multi-device vault sync.
- `iCloud` or other consumer cloud drives: workable for personal vaults, but watch for conflict copies and slower large-attachment sync.
- `git`: useful for versioned text history and reviewable note changes, but awkward for binary attachments and less technical collaborators.
- `Syncthing`: strong for peer-to-peer sync and local control, but it needs more disciplined setup across devices.

Recommendation:
- Pick one primary sync path for the vault to reduce conflict handling.
- Keep export/import as the conservative recovery path even when sync is enabled.
- If you use `git`, treat it as text-file versioning rather than a full attachment backup system.

## Obsidian-native notes

- Use `templates/OBSIDIAN-NOTE.md` for durable notes: YAML frontmatter, wikilinks, embeds, and attachment conventions.
- With Dataview, you can query your notes by `type`, `status`, `tags`, and `related`.

## Included files
